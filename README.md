## About yet.org

*yet.org* was created in 2006 by *SÃ©bastien Braun*, a innovation and tech enthusiast. It originally used *[Movable Types](http://www.movabletype.org/)* and was mostly talking about Science Fiction litterature. It then evolved as a *MediaWiki* [encyclopedia](http://wiki.yet.org).

As of end of end of november 2012 a new iteration to a fully static web site is on his way, it is based on the excellent *[nanoc](http://nanoc.stoneship.org/)* generator which I choosed because it's not only a blogging system but a great toolkit to build whatever comes out of your imagination. That's what I'm initiating with this *YET* makeover.

In this repository you'll find not only the code of *YET* but all the posts in MultiMarkdown format.

While creating this new incarnation, my journey were accelerated by the tons of information from people already using *nanoc*. I'd like to thank *Clark Dave* for his sharing, it helped a lot. 

It's now my turn to share, feel free to re-use whatever part of *YET*.

By the way, *YET* stands for *Yet Emerging Technologies*.
