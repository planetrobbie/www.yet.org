As you'll see in the following [*Python Enhancement Proposal* (PEP-0453)](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0453/) article, *Python 3.4* brings `pip` and `pyvenv` by default which is a great move to simplify *Python* dependencies management by offering a pre-built standard to download and install [*Python* Modules](https://pypi.python.org/pypi) and easily build virtual *Python* environments. In this article I'll details how to install *Python 3.4.2* from source and I'll show you how to use [pyvenv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/).

### Installation from source

First install the pre-requisite to compile Python 3.4 from source

		# sudo apt-get install build-essential

Download the latest source code from [python.org](http://python.org)

		$ wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.4.2/Python-3.4.2.tgz
		$ tar xvfz Python-3.4.2.tgz
		$ cd Python-3.4.2

Configure the source tree with the location of the target installation

		$ ./configure --prefix=~/python3.4

Compile Python 3.4.2

		$ make

Install it to your target directory

		$ make install

### Virtual Environment

Linux distribution comes with their own version of Python, so to use the one you just compiled, the easiest way is to use the bundled `pyvenv` tool.  

Create a new virtual environment

		$ cd myproject
		$ ~/python3.4/bin/pyvenv env34

Activate this environment

		$ source env34/bin/activate

You can now check everything looks good

		$ python --version
		Python 3.4.2

		$ which python

You should also see `(env34)` prepended to your shell prompt.

### Python Package installation

After you've activated your virtual environment, you can now install Modules into it by using `pip install` the usual way :

		$ pip install pyYAML

It will download and install the requested package in `env34/lib/python3.4/site-packages`

You can search for Modules within the *Python Package Index* (PyPI)

		$ pip search pecan

You can also upgrade pip

		$ python -m ensurepip --upgrade

### Deactivate your virtual environment

If you want to get back to the standard Python use

		deactivate

I hope this article will help you simplify your *Python* development workflow.
