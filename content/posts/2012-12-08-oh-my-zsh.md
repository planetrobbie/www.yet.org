It's for sure not the first or the last cooking article about Oh My Zsh!, but if you don't know it, just [try it](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh), you'll understand why so much people are blogging about it. So let's start by the official description. It's a community-driven framework initiated by *Robby Russel* for managing your zsh configuration. It includes 40+ optional plugins (rails, git,OSX, hub, capistrano, brew, ant, macports, etc), over 80 terminal themes to spice up your morning, and an auto-update tool so that makes it easy to keep up with the latest updates from the community. Looks great isn't it ? So let's digging it !

<!-- more -->

### Installation

1. If you trust *Robby Russell* Just type:  

	`% curl -L https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/raw/master/tools/install.sh | sh`

2. Or look around you'll find other ways. At the end of it, you should see: ![][oh-my-zsh-installed]

3. It's a good idea to switch over your `.bash_profile` stuff in your newly created `.zshrc`

4. If you use [*RVM*](https://rvm.io/), add the following lines at the end of you `~/.zshrc`  

	`[[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && source "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm"`

### Plugins

`~/.oh-my-zsh/plugins/` [plugins](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/tree/master/plugins/) storage location  
`~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/` your plugins  
`~/.zshrc` edit it to enable them  
`plugins=(git)` by default   
`plugins=(git github bundler)` the ones I'm currently using  
`_PLUGIN` indicates plugins that adds some autocompletion features.

### Themes

`~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/` [themes](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/tree/master/themes/) storage location, look at some [screenshots](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/themes).       
`ZSH_THEME` variable used to store theme configuration in your `~/.zshrc`  
`ZSH_THEME="robbyrussell"` by default  
`ZSH_THEME="agnoster"` the one I use ![][agnoster]

`agnoster` require some patched [fonts](https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-powerline/wiki/Patched-fonts), like [patched Menlo 14pt](https://gist.github.com/1595572), download and install them into `/usr/share/fonts` on *Linux*.  
`DEFAULT_USER` can be setup for agnoster not to display your regular username when logged in as yourself on local machine.

### Colors

You can now apply [*Solarized palette*](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) to your dircolors and terminal. Refer to my *Elementary* [article](/2012/11/elementary/) for details on how to apply it to *gnome-terminal*. For [*iTerm2*](http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home) on Mac OS X, just use the Profile preference menu.

### Uninstall

`% uninstall_oh_my_zsh` if you don't like it, this command revert back to your previous setup.

### Customization

`.oh-my-zsh/custom` add files ending with `.zsh` here to customize *Oh My Zsh!*  
`.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins` for new plugins.

### Zsh tips & tricks

As you'll dicover during your journey into this new world, among other things *Zsh* shares history among sessions. But as you can see below there is a lot more to it:

|command|meaning|
|:-|:-|
| `cd <TAB> <TAB>` |Directory completion|
| `ls -<TAB>`<br>`git commit -<TAB>` |Argument completion|
| `ls yet/**/.haml` |Deep search/globbing|
| `ls <UP>` |Filter out your history|
| `<Filename` |Pagination filename|
| `..`<br>`...`<br>`-` |Moving to the corresponding dir|


### Advanced idea

[Forking](https://github.com/planetrobbie/oh-my-zsh) *Oh My Zsh* is a great idea to keep a customized repository ready for consumption by all your nodes.  
Update the following files in your repository to make your own:

`~/.oh-my-zsh/tools/install.sh` update repository url with your own  
`~/.oh-my-zsh/README.textile` update repository url with your own  
`~/.oh-my-zsh/templates/zshrc.zsh-template` update to reflect your preferences, used to generate `~/.zshrc` at install time.  
`~/.oh-my-zsh/custom` put whatever customization there to avoid poluting anything else in the repository.  

Now to install from your own repo just type for example:

`wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/planetrobbie/oh-my-zsh/raw/master/tools/install.sh -O - | sh`
