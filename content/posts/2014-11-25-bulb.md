For quite some time, I've been using a lab based on 1U rackable servers, it was ok but far from perfect. First of all, it consume a fair share of power, generate lots of heat, so it's really really noisy. Maximum amount of RAM is also an issue with only 16GB supported. So beginning of this year I started the buildout of a new lab with the objective of reducing noise level to around 40 dB, support up to 64 GB RAM per node and simplify things even further by using VMware distributed storage (vSAN) technology. So let me introduce to my newly built **Bulb** Lab.
