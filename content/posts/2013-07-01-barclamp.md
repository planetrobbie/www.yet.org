As detailled in the official *[Crowbar](http://crowbar.github.com)* glossary, a **barclamp** is a set of data, templates and other necessary logic for applying a particular role to a node, or to some set of nodes. Interesting description isn't it. Let's dig in the anatomy of a barclamp.

<!-- more -->

For the non anglophone around, here is a real barclamp.

![][crowbar-barclamp]

As you've noticed, *Crowbar* terminology uses the toolbox vocabulary, you'll find Jig and other tools around, but that's for another day. Let's talk about the Barclamp today.

If you look at an [example](https://github.com/crowbar/barclamp-example) barclamp, here is what you've got in stock.

![][crowbar-barclampexample]

As you can see, it's a bunch of [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org), [ERB](http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0/libdoc/erb/rdoc/ERB.html), [JSON](http://json.org/), [HAML](/2012/11/haml/), [YAML](/2012/11/haml/), [MARKDOWN](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), it's like a family reunion isn't it.

### ./chef

The most significant component of a barclamp lies under the *Chef* directory. A barclamp is usefull to automate deployment of a [role](http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_roles.html) to a node, a role consist of a [run-list](http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_node_object_run_lists.html) and some [attributes](http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_cookbook_attribute_files.html). A run-list is an ordered list of roles or [recipes](http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_cookbook_recipes.html). And a recipe is stored in a [Cookbook](http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_cookbooks.html).

Seems complicated ? on the contrary when you'll get familiar with this terminology having such standard ways to name all the component helps a lot.

So in this directory you'll find all thoses required components: Cookbooks, Recipes, Roles, Attributes plus [templates](http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_cookbook_templates.html) and [data_bags](http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_data_bags.html). Before going any further you need to familiarize yourself with them by reading the corresponding *Chef* [documentation](http://docs.opscode.com).

Here is a brief summary

|glossary||
|:-:|:-|
|**cookbook**|defines a scenario, contain all the required components to support it: attributs, recipes, templates, ...|
|**recipe**|a collection of resources in a Ruby syntax|
|**role**|zero (or more) attributes and a run list|
|**run-list**|ordered list of roles and/or recipes|
|**template**|used to manage file contents with an ERB template|
|**attribute**|can be defined in a cookbook (or a recipe) and then used to override the default settings on a node|
|**data_bag**|global variable, stored as JSON data and is accessible from a *Chef* Server|

Let's take the [git barclamp](https://github.com/crowbar/barclamp-git) which is usefull to install and configure [git](http://git-scm.com/) on a node as an example. You'll find inside the *Chef* directory:

![][crowbar-barclampgit]

It's about:

* 2 recipes (config and install)
* 2 templates (authorized keys and upstart.conf)
* 1 git role to install and configure git on a node.
* 3 definitions (declares new resources) 

All this is pretty standard *Chef* stuff, but there is one more thing here, **data_bags/crowbar/bc-template-git.json** contains a new data bag which is used to tie-in Chef and Crowbar Framework together.

### crowbar.yml

Barclamp metadata. [This file](https://github.com/crowbar/barclamp-git/blob/master/crowbar.yml) directs the installation of the barclamp by the Crowbar Framework. The major stanzas are:

* **barclamps** - details about the barclamp itself
	* *name*
	* *display*
	* *description*
	* *proposal_schema_version*
	* *user_managed* - controls if barclamp is shown in UI list (true=yes)
	* *version*
	* *requires* - could use a another-barclamp or a @barclamp-group as dependency
	* *member* - allows you to declare that this barclamp is a member of a group of related barclamp.
	* *os_support* - declare that this barclamp only supports specific operating systems (support all by default)
* **crowbar** - installation instructions
	* *layout*
	* *order*
	* *run_order*
	* *chef_order*
	* *proposal_schema_version*
* **nav** - inject items in the Crowbar UI menu (if present)
* **debs** - to add an apt repository that the build system should pull packages from.
	* *repos* - add an apt repository that the build system should pull packages from (std sources.list format)
	* *ppas* - declare Ubuntu personal package archives that the build should try to pull from.
	* *pkg* - a list of extra packages that the build system will try to pull and cache on the crowbar iso image within /tftpboot/ubuntu-12.04/crowbar-extra/
	* *raw_pkgs* - a list of URLs to .deb packages that the build system will try to download and add to the iso (no dep checking, curl used to download .deb)
	* *os-token* - you can have multiple OS specific sections as well.
		* *repos*
		* *ppas*
		* *pkg*
		* *raw_pkgs*
* **rpms** - does the same thing that debs does for RPM-based systems.
	* *repos*
		* *rpm* - to use a repo that is set up using an RPM. (like EPEL).
		* *bare* - to use a repository that does not allow easy installation via rpm.
	* *pkgs* - put your rpms in this section
	* *raw_pkgs*
	* *pkg_sources* - pull a .src.rpm for use by the rest of the build system.
	* *os-token*
		* *build_cmd: your_shell_script.sh* - bash file called after the rest of the packages and files have been staged in the build cache. It should should have two functions declared 
			* bc_needs_build - return 0 if the external pkg needs building, 1 otherwise
			* bc_build See (README.build) - responsible for using the provided chroot enviromnent to build the external package.
* **gems** - declare the gems you need, including version, will resolve dependencies.
	* *pkgs* - put your gems in this section.
* **extra_files** - downloads and saves a file to be slipstreamed on to the crowbar .iso in the extra/files directory
* **locale_additions** - localization stuff

For more details consult /opt/dell/crowbar_framework/barclamp_model on an admin node.

### crowbar_framework/app

Crowbar leverage the *[Rails Framework](http://rubyonrails.org/)*, in this directory you'll find the corresponding components to be able to consume your barclamp through the Crowbar Rails application.

* controllers/git_controller - Overrides BarclampController
* models 
* views - defines UI stuffs

But this is now reworked as a crowbar_engine instead.

### crowbar_engine

I don't have much information regarding this new configuration architecture. I hope to update this section when more docs will come up from the dev team.

### ./bin

Contain binaries for /opt/dell/bin, which will be installed by barclamp_install.rb.

* Crowbar project [official web site](http://crowbar.github.io/home.html).

### Conclusion

Just keep in mind that a barclamp does not standalone but require the Crowbar Framework.
