In our first Boostrap *YET* [article](/2012/12/yet-infra/), we've seen how we could easily instantiate a new node at *HP Cloud* using [*knife hp*](https://github.com/mattray/knife-hp) and some *Chef Cookbooks*, *Roles*, ... Today we'll see how we can add Load Balancing into the picture using the [*HAProxy* cookbook](https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/haproxy).

### Add HA Proxy cookbook to your chef-repo

To install the community version of haproxy cookbook (it's not the latest one):

	% knife cookbook site install haproxy

Note: You could use [*Librarian-chef*](https://github.com/applicationsonline/librarian) or [*Berkshelf*](https://github.com/RiotGames/berkshelf) to manage your cookbooks dependencies in a cleaner way.

### Create a new Load Balancer role

	% knife role create yet_lb

	name	"yet_lb"
	description	"haproxy load balancer"
	
	run_list "recipe[haproxy::app_lb]"
	
	override_attributes "haproxy" => {
		 "app_server_role" => "yet_server",
		 "member_port" => "80",
	}

`haproxy::app_lb` recipe will automatically add nodes with the `yet_server` role which are in the same environment as the LB. It is based on the following *Chef* search:

	pool_members = search("node", "role:#{node['haproxy']['app_server_role']} AND chef_environment:#{node.chef_environment}") || []

### Bootstrap a Load Balancer

You can now instanciate a new node in the production_hpcloud environment with:

	% knife hp server create --flavor 100 --image 48335 --ssh-key USERNAME -N lb1.yet.org -r 'role[base],role[yet_lb]' --ssh-user ubuntu -E production_hpcloud

### Load Balancer Environment

In the previous bootstrap command we've used `-E production_hpcloud`, it will condition the load balancer to only search hosts that are in the same environment.

Note: you can read *OpsCode* [wiki](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Environments) for other ways to change your node environment. As soon as the Chef client runs on your LB, the pools will get updated in haproxy configuration:

##### File /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg

	# Set up application listeners here.
	listen application 0.0.0.0:80
	  balance roundrobin
	  server ww1 10.2.1.90:80 weight 1 maxconn 100 check
	  
### Add a new web server node

Use the following command to add a second web front-end :

	% knife hp server create --flavor 100 --image 48335 --ssh-key USERNAME -N ww2.yet.org -r 'role[base],role[yet_server]' -E 'production_hpcloud' --ssh-user ubuntu

As you can see below, as soon as chef-client runs on your haproxy node, its configuration gets updated:

##### File /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg

	# Set up application listeners here.
	listen application 0.0.0.0:80
	  balance roundrobin
	  server ww1 10.2.1.90:80 weight 1 maxconn 100 check
	  server ww2 10.2.1.91:80 weight 1 maxconn 100 check

That's all folks.
