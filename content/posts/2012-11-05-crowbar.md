*[Crowbar](http://robhirschfeld.com/crowbar)* is an Open Source solution to quickly provision new services from bare metal servers.

<!-- more -->

## Introduction
* Project initiated at Dell by *Rob Hirschfeld* and *Greg Althaus*
* It was originally built on top of *[Chef](http://opscode.com)*, Opscode Configuration Management Solution but is currently evolving as an agnostic solution to support other configuration management tools like *[Puppet](http://puppetlabs.com/)*.
* Crowbar includes a *[Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)* application to easily customize your environment.
* Crowbar currently support *[Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/)* 1.9.3 with RVM

## About Crowbar 2
* Crowbar2 is actively developed, the objective is to refactor Crowbar.
* Objectives: Make it easier, safer, faster and more productive to use
	* simplify use of *Chef* and eliminate *Crowbar* requirements in our *Opscode Chef* recipes
	* multiple versions of the same OS running for upgrades
	* Moving to a database, *Chef* isn't any more the primary DB for Crowbar objects. It will improve scalability.
	* Moving to Rails 3
	* Big disk support (enabling UEFI booting in Sledgehammer, will allow drives above 2 TB)

Read-on to get more in-depth details about the [roadmap](https://github.com/crowbar/crowbar/wiki/Roadmap) to Crowbar 2.

## What's new
### Online Mode
* Systems needs package refresh, they have an ongoing life, today *Crowbar* doesn't help here, it is standalone system.
* *Crowbar 2* will use external connectivity, will help to support multiple OS
* *Crowbar 2* upgrades to Barclamps will become possible
* Goal: Crowbar connected to the internet and pull down dependencies
* only HTTP outbound connection required
* [Polipo](http://www.pps.univ-paris-diderot.fr/~jch/software/polipo/) is currently considered as the cache engine to reduce WAN consumption, could be configured to use a proxy.
* Offline build will still be available.
* See [Etherpad](http://crowbar.sync.in/crowbar2-online)

### Network Models
* Users were complaining because it was needed to re-install in case of change to networking
* It will become easier to change networking after the fact with the database layer
* we create networks models in the barclamps for : vlans, bridges, switches,  ... outside of network.json
* treat networking more as an API - CRUD for adding networking and nodes to networks
* barclamps should be able to add, reuse, leverage networks
* See [Etherpad](http://crowbar.sync.in/crowbar2-network).

### Pull from Source
* See [Etherpad](http://crowbar.sync.in/crowbar2-pullsource)

### Heterogeneous OS
* There's a role on the node then you can pick the OS and the provisioner will setup that OS
* OS selection is currently an attribute on the node
* The deployer and provisioner use this attribute to make these choices
* You have to set this attribute before allocation
* Logic is just added to allow you to know which OSes are available
* In CB2, they become CMDB_Attributes that the provisioner
   * this comes out of the directory trees by discovery
   * right now, code can pick Ubuntu 12.04 and Centos 6.2 
   * we don't see a need right now to go backwards for older OS
* this is for exploration right now
* See [Ethepad](http://crowbar.sync.in/crowbar2-multi-os)

### Attribute Driven Recipes

### Installation methods
* Offline build [readme](https://github.com/crowbar/crowbar/blob/master/README.build) - recommended for general consumption
* Online install [readme](https://github.com/crowbar/crowbar/blob/master/README.online-install) - new method but still buggy
* Dev install [readme](https://github.com/crowbar/crowbar/wiki/Dev-tool-build) - best one for Crowbar developers
* Prebuilt [ISO](http://crowbar.zehicle.com/) - not really up to date
