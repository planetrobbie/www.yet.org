*[Crowbar](http://robhirschfeld.com/crowbar)* is an Open Source solution to quickly provision new services from bare metal servers.

<!-- more -->

## Introduction
* Project initiated at Dell by *Rob Hirschfeld* and *Greg Althaus*
* It was originally built on top of *[Chef](http://opscode.com)*, Opscode Configuration Management Solution but is currently evolving as an agnostic solution and will support *[Puppet](http://puppetlabs.com/)* soon.
* Crowbar includes a *[Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)* application to easily customize your environment.
* Crowbar currently support *[Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/)* 1.9.3 with RVM

## Crowbar2
* Crowbar2 is actively developed, the objective is to refactor Crowbar.
* Objectives: Make it easier, safer, faster and more productive to use
	* simplify use of Chef and eliminate Crowbar requirements in our Opscode Chef recipes
	* multiple versions of the same OS running for upgrades
	* Moving to a database, Chef isn't any more the primary db for Crowbar objects. Will improve scaling.
	* Moving to Rails 3
	* Big disk support (enabling UEFI booting in Sledgehammer, will allow drives above 2 TB)
	
### Network Models
* Users were complaining because it was needed to re-install in case of change to networking
* It will become easier to change networking after the fact with the database layer
* we create networks models in the barclamps for : vlans, bridges, switches,  ... outside of network.json
* treat networking more as an API - CRUD for adding networking and nodes to networks
* barclamps should be able to add, reuse, leverage networks

### Online Mode
* But offline mode will still be available
* Systems needs package refresh, they have an ongoing life, today Crowbar doesn't help here, it is standalone system.
* Crowbar2 will use external connectivity, will help to support multiple OS
* Crowbar2 upgrades to Barclamps will become possible
* Goal: Crowbar connected to the internet and pull down dependencies
