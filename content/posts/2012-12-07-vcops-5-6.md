*vCenter Operations Management Suite* is a solution to easily get an high level overview of the **Health**, **Risk** and **Efficience** of a virtual datacenter. This latest release integrates with *VMware Infrastructure Navigator* which will give you an insight of all the applications deployed within your VMs as well as their inter-dependencies. vCops now also integrates with *vCenter Configuration Manager* with a fourth supermetric called Compliance. This is a condensed howto about installing and configuring vCops version 5.6, released November 29, 2012.

### Prerequisites and Architecture

You first have to request a product evaluation on [*vmware.com*](https://my.vmware.com/group/vmware/evalcenter?p=vcenter-ops56) to get access to a virtual appliance (1.3 Go OVA) named *VMware vCenter Operations Manager 5.6.0*. That's all you need for now.

Before starting your installation, it's a good idea to read the [release notes](https://www.vmware.com/support/vcops/doc/vcops-56-vapp-release-notes.html).  

Our vCops vApp is distributed as an *Open Virtualization Format (OVF)* and contains two VMs:

* **UI VM**: present the results of the analytics in the form of badges and scores using a web based application. There is 3 different UI:
	* *vSphere UI*: standard dashboard
	* *Enterprise UI*: to build custom UI
	* *Administration UI*: interface to vCops maintenance and management tasks
* **Analytics VM**: collects data from vCenter, vCenter Configuration Manager and 3rd party data sources: metrics, topology and change events. There are 4 main components :
	* *Capacity and Performance Analytics*: check incoming metrics fir abnormalities in real time, updates health, scores, and gerenates alerts if needed.
	* *Capacity Collector*: Collects metrics and computes derived metrics
	* *FileSytem Database*: Stores the collected metrics statistics (FSDB)
	* *Postgre DB*: Stores all other data collected, including objects, relationships, events, dynamic thresholds, and alerts.

Gathering of all the metrics is done from an authenticated (PKI) SSL connection to the connected vCenters.

|The following Ports are used by vCops||
|:-|:-|
|**22**|enables SSH access to the vCops vApp|
|**80**|redirects to port 443|
|**443**|vCops admin portal and vCops Manager application|
|**1194**|Tunnel for the UI VM and Analytics VM|

#### Required Components/Informations:

* vCops license key
* vCenter version 4.0U2 or later
* ESX version 4.0 or later where to deploy the vApp
* Networking configuration (see below)
* vCenter Hostname or IP
* vCenter Password
* vCenter VirtualCenter Management Webservices must be running.
* Time synchronisation: ESX that host vCops and vCenter clock need to be in sync. vCops vApp clock is taken from the ESX host.
* IE 8.0/9.0 or Mozilla 3.6 or later with least 1024x768 pixels.

#### vApp resources requirements:

* for up to 1500 VMs: 600.000 metrics collected
	* 4 vCPU (UI: 2, Analytics: 2)
	* 16 GB RAM (UI: 7 GB, Analytics: 9 GB)
	* 900G disk (UI: 100GB, Analytics: 800 GB)
	* 1.500 IOPS
* up to 3000 VMs: 1.2 Million metrics
	* 8 vCPU (UI: 7 GB, Analytics: 4 )
	* 25 GB RAM (UI: 11 GB , Analytics: 14 GB)
	* 1.8 TB disk (UI: 200GB, Analytics: 1.6 GB)
	* 3.000 IOPS
* up to 6000 VMs: 2.5 Million metrics
	* 16 vCPU (UI: 11 GB, Analytics: 14 GB)
	* 34 GB RAM (UI: 13 GB, Analytics: 21 GB)
	* 3.6 TB disk (UI: 400GB, Analytics: 3.2 GB)
	* 6.000 IOPS

Note: Disk size need to be customized by the administrator by adding Hard Disk to VMs if the size of your environment requires it.
