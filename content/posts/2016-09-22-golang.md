With more and more applications, [Docker](http://www.slideshare.net/jpetazzo/docker-and-go-why-did-we-decide-to-write-docker-in-go), [InfluxDB](https://blog.gopheracademy.com/birthday-bash-2014/why-influxdb-uses-go/), [Kubernetes](https://blog.gopheracademy.com/birthday-bash-2014/kubernetes-go-crazy-delicious/), [etcd](https://coreos.com/etcd/), [Grafana](http://grafana.org/), using Go as their foundation, it's interesting to understand the reasoning behing it. In this article we'll also share some pointers and cheatsheet to learn Go.

### Introduction

Go was first introduced in 2007 at Google by *Robert Griesemer*, *Rob Pike* and *Ken Thompson*. The main objective was to solve their own issues. Google developpers were using C/C++, Java and Python, complexity was growing and it became harder to maintain a level of coherence between their different projects. All three creators shared their dislike of C++ complexity as a primary motivation for designing a new language. 

The main design decisions were:

* statically typed
* be readable, small, simple, robust and light
* support networking and multiprocessing.

### Installation

Go is currently available for Windows, MacOS, Linux and FreeBSD. Download and install Go from binaries available at [Golang](https://golang.org/dl/). As this time the current version is 1.7 which is a ~80Mb download but if you prefer you can install it from [source](https://golang.org/doc/install/source).

Once installed add the following path to your shell environment variable

    export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin

Setup a workspace directory and export it as well as the `bin` directory.

    mkdir ~/in/code/go
    export GOPATH=~/in/code/go
    export $PATH:$GOPATH/bin

`$GOPATH` directory will contain all the go code in the machine.

You can also create a directory for your own stuff

    mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/user

just replace `user` by your github username.

### Pros

Go, also written Golang offers the following benefits:

* Compiled
* Statically linked native binaries without external dependencies
* Clean syntax
* Simple Type system
* Concurrency primitives
* Rich standard library
* Great tools

### Go tour

An online guided tour is available just by typing:

    go tool tour

You can also run everything locally like this

    go get github.com/dupoxy/go-tour-fr/gotour
    cd $GOPATH/bin
    ./gotour

### Embedded Documentation

To serve the documentation locally Just type

    godoc -http=:6060 -play -index

### Go Tooling

* go help - more information about a command.
* go doc - documentation for any package
* go get - fetch dependencies online
* go fmt - format your source code automatically
* go test - runs all Test* functions in *_test.go
* go build - compile packages and dependencies
* go run - rapid script like prototyping

### Additional Go commands

* go version - print Go version
* go list ./... - lists the packages named by the import paths, start in the current directory ("./") and find all packages below that directory ("...")
* go install - installs the latest copy of the package into the pkg directory
* go clean - removes object files from package source directories
* go tool - runs the go tool command identified by the arguments 
* go vet - run go tool vet on packages which reports suspicious constructs.

### Packages

Store your packages in a directory which match its source location

    $GOPATH/src/github.com/yourname/ask

Corresponding Import Path is 

    import "github.com/yourname/ask"

Package names should be all lowercase

### Conclusion

Go is easier to install, test and adopt. Its KISS (Keep it simple, stupid) culture allows to broaden the community.

`go build` embed everything you need, no more install required in order to run what you need, having a single binary to distribute to your server is a great advantages (apart from libc !!!)

Go combines the development efficiency of interpreted or dynamic languages with the security of static languages.
