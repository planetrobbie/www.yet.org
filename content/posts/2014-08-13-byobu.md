Summer is a great period to find ways to improve your workflow a bit. One great little tool in this category is [Byobu](http://byobu.co/) from Dustin Kirkland, it's a light, text-based window manager which allow you to detach/reattach to session and quickly create and move between different windows over a single SSH connection. It improve on the idea of previous tools like [Tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/) or [GNU Screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/) but with a simpler approach.

### Installation

Ubuntu:

	# apt-get install byoby

ArchLinux

	# yaourt -Si byobu

OpenSUSE Factory

	# zypper addrepo http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/utilities/openSUSE_Factory/utilities.repo
	# zypper refresh
	# zypper install byobu

Fedora/RedHat/CentOS
	
	# yum install byobu

MacOS
	
	# brew install byobu

Consult the [offical documentation](http://byobu.co/downloads.html) for other ways or to install it from source.

Now to enable Byobu at login

	$ byobu-enable

Later on if you don't like it any more you can always deactivate it with

	$ byobu-disable

### Key bindings cheatsheet

Most what you need to know about Byobu is in cheatsheet below

|hotkey|action|
|:-|:-|
|F2|create a new window|
|F3/F4|move focus among window|
|F6|Detach session and logout|
|F8|Rename window|

That's almost it. But if you are curious here are below keybindings related to splitted windows

|hotkey|action|
|:-|:-|
|CTRL/SHIFT-F2|Create a vertical/horizontal split|
|SHIFT-F3/F4|move focus among splits|
|CTRL-F3/F4|move splits around|
|SHIFT-Left/Right/Up/Down|move focus among splits|
|CTRL-F6|kill split in focus|

I kept for the end the hotkeys that are rarely used

|hotkey|action|
|:-|:-|
|SHIFT-F5|Toggle between different status bar|
|CTRL-SHIFT-F5|Change background color of the status line|
|ALT-F12|Activate mouse support|

You'll find all the other keybindings by accessing the help menu behind F9 or Shift-F1.

I hope you'll enjoy Byobu as much as I do.
