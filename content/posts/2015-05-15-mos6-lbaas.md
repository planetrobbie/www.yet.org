Imagine if you could easily get a virtual load balanced IP address for your fleet of web servers hosted on OpenStack as soon as you need it without having to wait for the networking team who's managing the hardware load balancer to handle your request ?  

That's exactly what *OpenStack Neutron* is offering with its [Load Balancing as a Service](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Neutron/LBaaS) (LBaaS) technnology which first appeared as an experimental feature in the Grizzly release. It's built on the same model as the Network as a Service solution, an OpenStack operator can choose whatever load balancing technology which provides an OpenStack Neutron driver. Major load Balancing players like *[F5](https://f5.com/solutions/technology-alliances/openstack)* or *[Citrix](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Neutron/LBaaS/NetScaler)* offers or will offer LBaaS Neutron drivers. I don't have such devices in my backyard, so I'll use the Open Source reference implementation instead (HAproxyNSDriver), based on [HAProxy](http://www.haproxy.org/) and supported by a french [company](https://www.haproxy.com/company/) headquartered in Jouy-en-Josas by the way ! To make things even simpler, I'll also leverage the *Mirantis OpenStack* [Fuel Plugin](https://software.mirantis.com/download-mirantis-openstack-fuel-plug-ins/) for LBaaS which makes installing and configuring LBaaS a breeze.

### Pre-requisites

If you want to follow the exact same process, you need the following pre-requisites in your lab  

* [Fuel](https://software.mirantis.com/key-related-openstack-projects/project-fuel/) 6.0 master node
* The LBaaS Fuel Plugin available [here](https://software.mirantis.com/fuelÂ­plugins)
* Ubuntu glance image or any Linux Image with Python pre-installed.

### Installation

Start by copying the plugin to your Fuel master node

	scp lbaas-l-1.0.0.fp root@:fuel_master_node_ip:/tmp
	
You can now connect to your master node to install the plugin 

	ssh root@fuel_master_node_ip
	cd /tmp
	fuel plugins --install lbaas-1.0.0.fp

You should then get the following message
	
	Plugin lbaas-1.0.0.fp was successfully installed.

### Deploy a new OpenStack environment

It's now time to deploy a new OpenStack environment. I wrote an article few weeks ago on that, so I'm not repeating myself. The only difference with [this article](/2014/12/mos-6/) is the fact that I'm using KVM and Neutron with GRE segmentation as a baseline for this cloud instead of vSphere and nova-network, Neutron being a required component for LBaaS. You need to be using OVS or LinuxBridge Neutron plugin, In this article I'm using Open vSwitch.

Make sure you activate the plugin while answering the Fuel deployment wizard questions

![][mos6-lbaas-1]

Apart that follow the usual stuff or consult the official [documentation](http://docs.mirantis.com/openstack/fuel/fuel-6.0/)

From now on we suppose you've successfully deployed OpenStack Juno on at least two nodes: 1 controller, 1 compute. At the end of the Fuel deployment you should see a message like

![][mos6-lbaas-2]

### Consume LBaaS

The deployer have created for you an internal network, the orange network below (CIDR 12.0.0.0/24), so lets deploy 2 instances on it, they will be used as web backend for our load balancer. You can use any linux distribution you want, I'm using Ubuntu 14.04 for web01 and web02 shown below.
 
![][mos6-lbaas-3]

You need to setup a Security Group which allows at least SSH, ICMP and Web traffic to your Instances.

![][mos6-lbaas-4]

Click on Load Balancers

![][mos6-lbaas-5]

Create a LB Pool

![][mos6-lbaas-6]

Add our web01 and web02 members

![][mos6-lbaas-7]

Add an HTTP Monitor 

![][mos6-lbaas-8]

When I tried to associate a monitor to my Pool, I encountered a UI issue, the list of monitors were empty. So I used the CLI instead. First I gathered the ID of my Pool with

	neutron lb-pool-list

We also need to get the ID of our HTTP Monitor

	neutron lb-healthmonitor-list

We can now associate it with

	neutron lb-healthmonitor-associate <MONITOR_ID> <POOL_ID>

If you want you can associate multiple monitors to your Pool.

Last but not least, add a VIP to your Pool

![][mos6-lbaas-9]

![][mos6-lbaas-10]

But that's not the end of it yet, we need to associate a floating IP to our VIP which live inside the internal network. Reach the `Compute > Access & Security` Menu and click on the `Floating IP` tab. Allocate at least one IP to your project and associate it with your VIP.

![][mos6-lbaas-11]

The LBaaS configuration is now done, in the next section we'll be using a trick to quickly setup something to listen on Port 80 on both of our VMs.

### Web Instances

We started this exercice by deploying two Ubuntu instances, but neither of them are listening on port 80 for our test. So SSH to them and launch the following command (replace X by 1 or 2) :
	
	ssh -l ubuntu <INSTANCE_FLOATING_IP>
	echo "You've reach WEB0-X" > ./index.html
	sudo python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80

Note: If you can reach any of them, you maybe forgot one of the following

* assign a floating IP to each instance
* associate a Security Group which allows SSH.
* use a public key for which you have the private key on your client machine

### Final test

To check that everything works as expected, try to access VIP Floating IP (10.0.0.130) from your browser, you should see

		You've reach WEB01  

or

		You've reach WEB01  

You can reload the page, it should alternate if you choosed the round robin algorithm without any stickyness. You can also kill any of the two Python command to see *HAProxy* managing to put the instance out of the Pool and stick to the living one.

### LBaaS Architecture

You have to take note that your Load Balancer is one armed, its connected to one subnet with one interface, and so will SRC NAT the Client IP Address. If you need to get the client IP address, you can get it from the *X-Forwarded-For* Header information.  

Your tenant Load Balancer lives within a Linux namespace, it is being scheduled on the Neutron node by the LBaaS agent, and will create a `qlbaas-*` namespace. To investigate the namespaces use the following workflow

	ip netns

identify the `qlbaas-*` namespace you need to investigate and run commands within that namespace using

	ip netns exec qlbaas-XXXXXXXXXXXX ip a

You can check the current status of your LBaaS agent like this

	service neutron-lbaas-agent status

### HAProxy Supported Features

LB Algorithms

* **Round robin**
* **Least connections**
* **Source IP**

Monitors

* **TCP** (just a SYN test)
* **HTTP** (check status code)
* **HTTPS** (check status code)

Session persistence algorithms with HAproxy backend configuration in parenthesis

* **SOURCE_IP** (stick-table type ip size 10k)
* **HTTP_COOKIE** (injected by HAproxy -> cookie SRV insert indirect nocache / stick on src)
* **APP_COOKIE** (injected by you application, 56 caracters retained -> appsession <CookieName> len 56 timeout 3h)


### LBaaS Configuration

Lets now look at the backend configuration that allows Neutron to drive *HAProxy* as a Service. 

LBaaS agent configuration lives within `/etc/neutron/lbaas_agent.ini`.

#### Interface Driver

The Fuel Plugin have added for us the following line to configure the LBaaS Interface Driver which is leveraging Open vSwitch

	interface_driver=neutron.agent.linux.interface.OVSInterfaceDriver

Note for LinuxBridge it's instead `neutron.agent.linux.interface.BridgeInterfaceDriver`

#### Device Driver

A Device Driver which provides the interface between the Neutron API and the programming of the load balancer is also required and configured in the same file like this

	device_driver=neutron.services.loadbalancer.drivers.haproxy.namespace_driver.HaproxyNSDriver

#### OpenStack Dashboard

Horizon need to be informed to change its UI to add LB configuration capabilities. You have to enable LB in its `/etc/openstack-dashboard/local_settings.py`

	'enable_lb': True

And restart the web server

	service httpd restart

#### Service Plugin and Service Provider

Last but not least, Neutron must be configured to use a LBaaS **Service Plugin** in its config file `/etc/neutron/neutron.conf`

	service_plugins =neutron.services.l3_router.l3_router_plugin.L3RouterPlugin,neutron.services.metering.metering_plugin.MeteringPlugin,lbaas

Now configure a **Service Provider**

	service_provider=LOADBALANCER:Haproxy:neutron.services.loadbalancer.drivers.haproxy.plugin_driver.HaproxyOnHostPluginDriver:default

When you change its configuration file you need to restart Neutron Server

	service neutron-server restart

#### Tenant LB configuration

Each tenant created Load Balancer configuration file reside within `/var/lib/neutron/lbaas/LB_ID/conf/`. The LB_ID can be found using `ip netns` on the neutron node where the agent scheduled the tenant LB or from the Horizon Dashboard.

### CLI Management

We've done most of our operations using the Horizon Dashboard, but as you can imagine eveything could be done from the CLI. Here is a cheatsheet of all the commands available.

#### Pool

	lb-pool-create --tenant-id <TENANT_ID> --description <DESCRIPTION> --lb-method <{ROUND_ROBIN, LEAST_CONNECTION, SOURCE_IP}> --name <NAME> -protocol <PROTO> --subnet-id <SUBNET> 
	lb-pool-delete <POOL>
	lb-pool-list
	lb-pool-show <POOL>
	lb-pool-stats <POOL>
	lb-pool-update <POOL> --description <DESCRIPTION> --lb-method {ROUND_ROBIN, LEAST_CONNECTION, SOURCE_IP}
	lb-pool-list-on-agent <LBAAS_AGENT>
	
Most of the commands above are obvious, lets details the `lb-pool-list-on-agent` command which allows you to get the list of Pools associated with an agent. Each tenant LB will be scheduled to one of your agent, so knowing were it runs will help you troubleshoot the environment. `LBAAS_AGENT` is the ID or name of an LBaaS agent, you can get that information using `neutron agent-list`.

#### Member

	lb-member-create --tenant-id <TENANT_ID> --admin-state-down -weight <WEIGHT> --address <IP> --protocol-port <PORT>
	lb-member-delete <MEMBER>
	lb-member-list --pool-id <POOL>
	lb-member-show <MEMBER>
	lb-member-update <MEMBER> --weight <WEIGHT> XXX CHECK JUNO CAPACIBILITY HERE MAYBE BETTER THAN JUST WEIGHT XXX

#### Health Monitor

	lb-healthmonitor-create --tenant-id <TENANT_ID> --admin-state-down --expected-codes <EXPECTED> --http-method <HTTP_METHOD> --url-part <URL> --delay <DELAY> --max-retries <MAX> --timeout <TIMEOUT> --type <{PING, TCP, HTTP, HTTPS}>
	lb-healthmonitor-delete <MONITOR>
	lb-healthmonitor-associate <MONITOR> <POOL>
	lb-healthmonitor-disassociate <MONITOR> <POOL>
	lb-healthmonitor-list
	lb-healthmonitor-show <MONITOR>
	lb-healthmonitor-update <MONITOR>

#### VIP

	lb-vip-create --tenant-id <TENANT_ID> --admin-state-down --address <IP> --connection-limit <LIMIT> --description <DESC> --name NAME --protocol-port <PORT> --protocol <{TCP, HTTP, HTTPS}> --subnet-id <SUBNET> <POOL>
	lb-vip-delete <VIP>
	lb-vip-list
	lb-vip-show <VIP>
	lb-vip-update <VIP> --connection-limit <LIMIT> --pool-id <POOL> --session-persistence type=dict type=<{HTTP_COOKIE, SOURCE_IP}>
	lb-vip-update <VIP> --connection-limit <LIMIT> --pool-id <POOL> --session-persistence type=dict type=<APP_COOKIE,cookie_name=NAME>

Note: the only way to configure a session persistence from command line is to use the update CLI.

### Putting everything together

Here is a session example that reproduce the configuration we've done earlier using Horizon Dashboard

	neutron lb-pool-create --description "Web App" --lb-method ROUND_ROBIN --name web-pool --protocol HTTP --subnet-id <ID>
	neutron lb-member-create --address 12.0.0.4 --protocol-port 80 web-pool
	neutron lb-healthmonitor-create --delay 5 --max-retries 3 --timeout 16 --type HTTP XXX
	neutron lb-healthmonitor-associate <MONITOR> <POOL>
	neutron lb-vip-create --description "web app VIP" --name web-vip --protocol-port 80 --protocol HTTP --subnet-id ID web-pool

### Logging

Logging information for your LBaaS agent can be found at `/var/log/neutron/lbaas-agent.log`

### Conclusion

OpenStack LBaaS enable many new use cases and when you connect the dots with Heat (OpenStack orchestration), it becomes possible to deploy a 3-tier application entirely including the load balancer, great isn't it. But it is still early days, to give you an idea of the current limitation of this solution:

* It's not currently possible to create multiple virtual servers using the same IP Address and different Ports
* SSL Offloading is not supported
* Layer-7 LB not supported

But it's a good starting point. I hope this article was usefull and that you've successfully deployed and configured LBaaS and had a little bit of fun in doing it.
